As mentioned in the previous article I will discuss creating I will discuss creating microservices using .net core step by step. I would like to make this article as multi part article with below topics which would help in building the production grade microservices application.

1.	[Microservices with .Net Core with Swagger integration] (https://github.com/kaushik74/.NetCore-Microservice)
2.	Using RabbitMQ for .Net Core Microservices
3.	Using Redis cache in .Net Core Microservices
4.	Distributed Transactions
5.	Unit Testing and DevOps capabilities.
